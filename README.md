Excited to share my latest project using ASP.NET Core MVC!

I built a simple but functional application that manages employee and department details, featuring basic CRUD operations. Here are some key highlights:

View, create, update, and delete employee profiles

Manage company departments with detailed views and the ability to create new ones

Search functionality to quickly find employees or departments by name


Special thanks to ChatGPT for assisting with the views and to Bootswatch and ColorLib for the sleek theme that gave the project a polished look!
